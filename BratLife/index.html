      <h2>What Happened</h2>
      <p>This website shares my personal experience with the Brat Life Discord and Reddit communities. Everything here reflects events I lived through, with documentation to support it. This is not harassment, retaliation, or gossip—it is my truth, and I have the right to share it.</p>
      <p>At some point staying silent is the problem. At some point looking the other way becomes complicity. And pretending it doesn’t matter because it’s “just Discord” or “just Reddit” becomes a way to protect the people who hurt others without ever being held accountable.</p>
      <p>I was banned from the Brat Life Discord server without warning, without explanation, and without ever breaking a rule. A former moderator confirmed the server owner bans people simply for having their own communities. Not for harm. Just perceived threat.</p>
      <p>When I shared this on Reddit in r/BratLife, I was muted for 28 days and then temporarily banned for “harassment”—even though I never named anyone or contacted anyone directly. My post was respectful, honest, and rooted in real experience.</p>
      <p>If we can’t talk about what happens to us, how do we grow? How do we hold power accountable?</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Brat Life is an online kink community that operates both on Reddit (r/BratLife) and through a private Discord server. It was created to support brat-identified kinksters in expressing themselves in playful, rebellious, and emotionally open ways. The community presents itself as safe, inclusive, and aligned with consent-based communication. However, the internal practices and moderator actions have raised serious concerns regarding fairness, transparency, and emotional harm to its members.</p>

      <article id="history-what-happened">
        <h3>What Happened to Me</h3>
        <p>I was banned from the Brat Life Discord server without warning, conversation, or explanation. I was not accused of breaking any rules, and no moderator contacted me. The only explanation I later received—from a former moderator—was that the server owner regularly bans users who run or participate in other kink-related Discord servers. This means people are being removed not for harm, but simply for existing outside of the Brat Life bubble.</p>
        <p>When I tried to talk about my experience publicly, I posted in the r/BratLife Reddit venting thread, which is specifically designated for emotional processing and truth-sharing. My post was respectful, factual, and included no personal attacks or falsehoods. The moderators not only removed the post without justification—they also banned me from the subreddit and did not reply to my appeal.</p>
        <p>When I attempted to appeal this ban using the appropriate Reddit channels, my account was mass-reported and muted, preventing me from sending any further messages or discussing the issue. At no point did I harass, threaten, or break Reddit’s content policy. I was silenced for telling the truth about what happened to me.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="history-pattern">
        <h3>Pattern of Behavior</h3>
        <p>What happened to me is not isolated. There is a clear and troubling pattern of behavior in Brat Life moderation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Unexplained Discord Bans:</strong> Users are banned from the Discord server without any conversation or warning.</li>
          <li><strong>Punishment for Participation Elsewhere:</strong> Users have been removed simply for owning or participating in other communities, even without conflict or poaching.</li>
          <li><strong>Reddit Post Suppression:</strong> Posts that mention emotional harm, exclusion, or critique of moderation are removed quickly—regardless of tone or truth.</li>
            <li><strong>Muting and Reporting:</strong> Users who appeal bans or try to engage respectfully are muted or mass-reported to Reddit, preventing further discussion.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Over Accountability:</strong> There is no process for moderator accountability or community feedback. Moderators have final say and rarely respond when challenged.</li>
            <li><strong>Server Tag Restrictions:</strong> Brat Life will not allow users to join if their profile shows certain server tags.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

      <article id="history-harm">
        <h3>Emotional Harm and Impact</h3>
        <p>This behavior causes real harm. Being banned and silenced without cause creates deep emotional stress, especially in communities where people seek safety, identity, and connection. When moderators use power to shut down critique, they discourage vulnerability. When appeals are ignored or punished, they erode trust. When bans are issued for arbitrary reasons, they isolate and invalidate people who came in good faith.</p>
        <p>The damage isn’t just administrative—it’s psychological. It tells users: "Your pain is inconvenient. Your voice is dangerous. Your presence is unwelcome." That’s the opposite of what kink communities should stand for.</p>

      <article id="history-receipts">
        <h3>Receipts &amp; Confirmations</h3>
        <p>I have documented every part of my experience and will continue to make that available publicly. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Screenshot: Confirmation from a former moderator that users were banned simply for owning other servers</li>
          <li>Screenshot: Clear statements from other users that I did not invite anyone or violate community rules</li>
          <li>Screenshot: Reddit mute and ban messages showing no justification or response</li>
          <li>Screenshot: Moderator messages describing an "insta-ban" policy for talking about other servers</li>
          <li>Screenshot: Poaching accusations with no evidence or conversation</li>
          <li>Screenshot: Admin response admitting to an active blacklist</li>
          <li>Screenshot: Documentation that blacklist entries use multiple name variations</li>
          <li>Screenshot: Warning tags issued when users mention outside communities</li>
          <li>Screenshot: Reports from banned members who experienced the same treatment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of this is available to view and verify upon request. These receipts are not shared to attack, but to document a pattern that deserves attention and change.</p>

      <article id="history-why">
        <h3>Why This Page Exists</h3>
        <p>This website exists not to stir drama, but to tell the truth. I’m not here to retaliate. I’m here because what happened hurt—and it keeps happening to others. If you say you’re a community built on communication and consent, then that should include criticism, conflict repair, and mutual accountability.</p>
        <p>This page exists to give a voice back to people who were silenced. To remind the community that safety includes emotional safety. And to call for Brat Life—and any similar community—to reflect on its power structures and change.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="history-share">
        <h3>Share Your Story</h3>
        <p>If something like this has happened to you in Brat Life or any other online kink community, you’re not alone. You’re invited to share your experience—anonymously or publicly. If you have screenshots or receipts, I will review and include them here with your consent, to build a record that speaks louder than any single post could.</p>

      <h2>Share Your Story</h2>
      <p>If you’ve also been silenced, excluded, or harmed by Brat Life (or a similar community), I’d love to hear from you. I’m open to posting your story—with or without your name—and sharing receipts to help bring truth to light.</p>
      <p>You can send me screenshots, descriptions, or even anonymous messages. I believe stories matter. Yours does too.</p>
      <p>If you have at least a year of Discord history, you can <a href="https://discord.gg/SUq66wPs" target="_blank">send me a friend request</a> and share what happened. I can include your story anonymously without fear of BL attacking you. If anyone tries to silence us the way they did on Discord or Reddit, we’ll have a record of who does it.</p>
