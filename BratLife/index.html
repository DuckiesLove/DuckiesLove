      <h2>What Happened</h2>
      <p>This website shares my personal experience with the Brat Life Discord and Reddit communities. Everything here reflects events I lived through, with documentation to support it. This is not harassment, retaliation, or gossip—it is my truth, and I have the right to share it.</p>
      <p>At some point staying silent is the problem. At some point looking the other way becomes complicity. And pretending it doesn’t matter because it’s “just Discord” or “just Reddit” becomes a way to protect the people who hurt others without ever being held accountable.</p>
      <p>I was banned from the Brat Life Discord server without warning, without explanation, and without ever breaking a rule. A former moderator confirmed the server owner bans people simply for having their own communities. Not for harm. Just perceived threat.</p>
      <p>When I shared this on Reddit in r/BratLife, I was muted for 28 days and then temporarily banned for “harassment”—even though I never named anyone or contacted anyone directly. My post was respectful, honest, and rooted in real experience.</p>
      <p>If we can’t talk about what happens to us, how do we grow? How do we hold power accountable?</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Brat Life is an online kink community that operates both on Reddit (r/BratLife) and through a private Discord server. It was established to provide a space for brat-identified kinksters to connect, share, and express themselves freely within safe boundaries. It attracted a large number of users who were seeking inclusive, emotionally intelligent kink conversation.</p>

      <article id="history-what-happened">
        <h3>What Happened to Me</h3>
        <p>I was an active member in both the Reddit and Discord communities, participating within their rules. Without any warning or cited rule violation, I was banned from the Brat Life Discord server. No moderator reached out. I later discovered through a former moderator that users were being banned for simply having their own separate Discord servers, regardless of behavior or conduct.</p>
        <p>When I attempted to share this experience on Reddit—in a designated venting thread—I was muted for 28 days. My post was not aggressive, harassing, or rule-breaking. It simply told the truth of my experience and the harm it caused. I was later temporarily banned from Reddit as well, under a false harassment claim.</p>

      <article id="history-pattern">
        <h3>Pattern of Behavior</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Users being banned from Discord for unrelated community ownership</li>
          <li>Moderators issuing bans without warning or conversation</li>
          <li>Reddit mods muting users who express concern or criticism</li>
          <li>Suppression of valid, non-aggressive personal experiences</li>
          <li>Former mods confirming the use of bans for control, not behavior</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article id="history-evidence">
        <h3>Receipts &amp; Confirmations</h3>
        <p>These are some of the screenshots and statements supporting my claims:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Screenshot: Former mod confirms bans are issued based on users having their own servers</li>
          <li>Screenshot: Confirmation I did not invite others to a server, disproving the rumored justification for my ban</li>
          <li>Reddit mute screenshot showing 28-day gag with no explanation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These receipts are available in the evidence section or by request for transparency and documentation.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="history-outcome">
        <h3>Outcome &amp; Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>Communities built on power-with rather than power-over require accountability and structure. Silencing users who speak about emotional harm, excluding people for existing outside one community, and punishing dissent without due process erodes psychological safety and discourages vulnerability.</p>
        <p>This page is here to tell the truth, invite others to share their experiences, and encourage Brat Life—and similar spaces—to reflect and grow. This is not harassment. It’s documentation and lived experience.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="history-share">
        <h3>Share Your Story</h3>
        <p>If you have had a similar experience in Brat Life or a related community and would like to share your truth or provide receipts, you are invited to submit anonymously. These may be published to encourage transparency and reform, with your permission.</p>

      <h2>Share Your Story</h2>
      <p>If you’ve also been silenced, excluded, or harmed by Brat Life (or a similar community), I’d love to hear from you. I’m open to posting your story—with or without your name—and sharing receipts to help bring truth to light.</p>
      <p>You can send me screenshots, descriptions, or even anonymous messages. I believe stories matter. Yours does too.</p>
      <p>If you have at least a year of Discord history, you can <a href="https://discord.gg/SUq66wPs" target="_blank">send me a friend request</a> and share what happened. I can include your story anonymously without fear of BL attacking you. If anyone tries to silence us the way they did on Discord or Reddit, we’ll have a record of who does it.</p>
