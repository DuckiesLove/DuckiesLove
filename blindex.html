    <h1>My Story: Why I Spoke Up</h1>

      <h2>What Happened</h2>
      <p>This website shares my personal experience with the Brat Life Discord and Reddit communities. Everything here reflects events I lived through, with documentation to support it. This is not harassment, retaliation, or gossip—it is my truth, and I have the right to share it.</p>
      <p>At some point staying silent is the problem. At some point looking the other way becomes complicity. And pretending it doesn’t matter because it’s “just Discord” or “just Reddit” becomes a way to protect the people who hurt others without ever being held accountable.</p>
      <p>I was banned from the Brat Life Discord server without warning, without explanation, and without ever breaking a rule. A former moderator confirmed the server owner bans people simply for having their own communities. Not for harm. Just perceived threat.</p>
      <p>When I shared this on Reddit in r/BratLife, I was muted for 28 days and then temporarily banned for “harassment”—even though I never named anyone or contacted anyone directly. My post was respectful, honest, and rooted in real experience.</p>
      <p>If we can’t talk about what happens to us, how do we grow? How do we hold power accountable?</p>

      <h2>Share Your Story</h2>
      <p>If you’ve also been silenced, excluded, or harmed by Brat Life (or a similar community), I’d love to hear from you. I’m open to posting your story—with or without your name—and sharing receipts to help bring truth to light.</p>
      <p>You can send me screenshots, descriptions, or even anonymous messages. I believe stories matter. Yours does too.</p>
